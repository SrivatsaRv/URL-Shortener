# URL-Shortener
A simple and easy to use web app built using Django

Wanna try this app? Visit: http://shly.pythonanywhere.com/

I developed this app after watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMZMm_0ZhK4) by Tushar Roy about tiny url.
I wanted my own solution and was also interested in particle.js hence this project was born.

## Features:

*   Url shortening using [base62](https://www.kerstner.at/2012/07/shortening-strings-using-base-62-encoding/) encoding.  (a-zA-Z0-9)
*   Beautiful background using [particle.js](http://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/)
*   Fully responsive. use any device and always find the best layout.

## How to run the project locally

`git clone https://github.com/shubhamnishad97/URL-Shortener.git`
